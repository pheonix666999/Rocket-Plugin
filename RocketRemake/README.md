# The Rocket (Remake)

This is a from-scratch remake of the demo plugin shipped as `The Rocket.pkg` (macOS AU demo) using JUCE.

Goals:
- Match the demo plugin identifiers/behavior.
- Public UI: one macro knob + preset selector.
- Internal UI: rack-style preset designer (FX chain + mapping + save/load).

Build notes:
- JUCE sources are reused from `The Rocket/JUCE_SRC/` in this workspace.
